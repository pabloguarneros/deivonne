The First Step: Making Smart Contracts User-Friendly.

## The problem

The midterms in Mexico were two week ago. But as our teammate said, "A lot of people died in my country. It was not a day to celebrate." Right before the Mexican election, 40 people that were running for office got killed. Ivonne Gallegos was one of them. Our teammate wanted to honor this project to her and the other candidates that died.

So what can we do?

The First Step: Making Smart Contracts User-Friendly.

We wanted to use Smart Contracts to reduce a heated election cycle. We did not want to keep bracing ourselves every four years for violent, money-wasting campaigns. We wanted to make democracy in real-time and take the pressure of a centralized node, like Ivonne, that can be targetted.

The ability to vote through block-chain is not new. But as we looked at the resources listing smart contracts like misualizer or better-call, we didn't see how most of the 110 million Mexicans (or most of the rest of world) could feel invited to the blockhain. Because Smart Contracts are transparent. But they are not yet accessible.

According to Statista, a third of Mexico is on Instagram. What better way to present Smart Contracts, and their potential to decentralize politics, than to present the database as Instagram.

Currently, the Smart Contracts that appear in our app are connected to a specific Sustainable Development Goal ("you can see the options in the Django models"). In the future, we would like users to vote or give funds to specific campaigns through the app. Our motto, making political action as easy as it is to like an Instagram picture.

## What we found out

A problem we ran into included debating the feasibility of our project. Yes, we wanted to decentralize democracy. But we debated constantly on whether (1) Smart Contracts could be adopted by governments and (2) whether our solution would do what it was required. At the beginning we were ambitious, we wanted to have users create the contracts themselves within our platform and be able to vote and decide on specific funds to send to the bakers. However, one of our core teammate had a family emergency and then we ran into issues we hadn't foreseen. However, we thought, "Okay, we can't do X, Y, and Z. But if we had to choose one, which one would it be?" At the end, we thought the first step to decentralize politics would be to have people join the movement of decentralization. My making Smart Contracts as user-friendly as possible, we thought, "Okay, this is a good start. We'll be able to add on to the idea." For now, we are just happy to have learned so much and think of the project and the problem as the start of a long journey of debugging (both code and politics).
